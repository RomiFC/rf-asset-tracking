# rfid-asset-tracking

Realtime asset tracking system utilizing UWB technology and code from Qorvo. This project was initially going to be accomplished with passive tags and an RFID system design but was abandoned due to poor node sensitivity. The new design utilizes Qorvo's MDEK-1001 development boards and multiple Raspberry Pi 3B computers. For more information, see the [official documentation](Documentation/Final%20Report.pdf).
